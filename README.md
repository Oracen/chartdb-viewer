# ChartDB Layout Viewer

Loved the look of the ER diagram viewer from ChartDB! I needed something to interact with DBs from a graphical POV, so I pulled out the core code and made it a standalone project. It's much less flexible, but probably more usable for the average working programmer.

All credit goes to the original authors of ChartDB, my contribution is mostly deletions. (`npx dead-exports` is my new best friend now.) Check out their product, its slickness makes me sad I'm not at that level.
